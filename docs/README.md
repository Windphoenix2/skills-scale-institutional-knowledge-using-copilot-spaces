# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This README serves as your entry point to understanding how we run projects, collaborate across teams, and deliver value to our customers.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our process is designed to help cross-functional teams deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining high quality standards.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable fast feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

## Key Workflows

OctoAcme projects follow a five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Validate business need, identify stakeholders, and create a project one-pager
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, estimate scope, and define release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate using our established team rhythms
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

### Team Rhythm

- **Daily standups** (15 min): Progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly delivery sync**: Show progress, updates, and flagged risks
- **Weekly PM + Product Manager alignment**: Strategic sync on priorities and outcomes
- **Twice-weekly team standups**: Or as agreed by the delivery team
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Keep broader organization informed
- **Sprint/milestone demos**: Review completed work and gather feedback

## Personas & Roles

Our teams consist of several key roles, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

Each role works together to ensure successful project delivery while maintaining clear accountability.

## Communication Strategies

Effective communication is essential to our success. We maintain:

- **Single source of truth**: Project README or release doc for status updates
- **Regular cadence**: Weekly status updates and milestone-based communications
- **Risk transparency**: Weekly risk register reviews and proactive escalation
- **Stakeholder alignment**: Tailored communication for different audience groups (engineering, sales, support)

### Escalation Paths

- **Level 1**: Team-level triage in daily standup
- **Level 2**: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
- **Level 3**: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues
- **Security incidents**: Follow security incident runbook and notify Security on-call

## Quality Assurance Practices

Quality is built into every phase of our process:

- **Unit tests** for new logic
- **Integration tests** where applicable
- **End-to-end smoke tests** for critical flows before release
- **Security scanning** in CI pipeline
- **Manual QA** for feature acceptance when needed
- **Pull Request workflow**: Small PRs (<= 400 lines when possible) with required approvals
- **Definition of Done**: Clear criteria for what "complete" means
- **Automated CI/CD**: Tests and linting run before merge

### Key Artifacts

Every project maintains:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
