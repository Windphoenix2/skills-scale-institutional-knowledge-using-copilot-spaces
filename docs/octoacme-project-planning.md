# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Business Analyst gathers detailed requirements and creates functional specifications
3. UX/UI Designer creates wireframes and prototypes for user-facing features
4. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (with input from BA and Designer)
5. QA Lead reviews acceptance criteria for testability and defines testing approach
6. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
7. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality and design standards
8. Identify dependencies and integration points
9. Release Manager reviews timeline and coordinates release planning
10. Create release plan and milestone map
