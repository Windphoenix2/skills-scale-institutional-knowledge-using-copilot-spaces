# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Include all core team members: PM, PdM, Developers, QA Lead, UX/UI Designer, Release Manager, Business Analyst
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure each role has opportunity to share their perspective:
  - QA Lead: quality metrics, testing challenges, defect trends
  - UX/UI Designer: design process, implementation fidelity, usability insights
  - Release Manager: deployment smoothness, rollout issues, automation opportunities
  - Business Analyst: requirements clarity, stakeholder feedback, UAT effectiveness

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Assign action items to appropriate roles based on expertise:
  - Quality improvements → QA Lead
  - Design process improvements → UX/UI Designer
  - Release process improvements → Release Manager
  - Requirements gathering improvements → Business Analyst
  - Cross-functional process improvements → Project Manager
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
